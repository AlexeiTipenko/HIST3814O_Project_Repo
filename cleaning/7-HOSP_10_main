Owing to the fact that the unit was administering Hospitals in five separate buildings (two at EASTBOURNE and three at SEAFORD) a larger number of men were required in the various Departments than would have been the case in one compact building or camp. Some difficulty was experienced in obtaining sufficient additional personnel to cope with the requirements. Convalescent patients were largely employed on light duties around the Hospitals.
